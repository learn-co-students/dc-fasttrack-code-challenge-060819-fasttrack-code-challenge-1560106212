# Badges and Schedules

You're hosting a conference and need to print badges for the speakers. Each badge should say: "Hello, my name is _____."

**Write a method that will create and return this message, given a person's name.**

Now the list of speakers is finalized, and you can send the list of badges to the printer. *Remember that you'll need to give this list to the printer, so it should be accessible outside of the method.*

**Modify your method so it can take a list of names as an argument and return a list of badge messages.** 

Your conference speakers are: `Edsger, Ada, Charles, Alan, Grace, Linus and Matz.` How you scored these luminaries is beyond me, but way to go!

You just realized that you also need to give each speaker a room assignment. You have rooms 1-7. You'll need to print this for the speakers, so make sure to return a list of room assignments in the form of: "Hello, _____! You'll be assigned to room _____!"

**Write a method that assigns each speaker to a room, and make sure that each room only has one speaker. Return a list of room assignments** 

Now you have to tell the printer what to print. Create a method that will output the results of the badge method and schedule method to the screen so the printer can do his thing.

**Write a method to run the rest of your program and print the results to the screen. No other method should print to the screen.**
